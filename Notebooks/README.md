# Notebooks

A list of notebooks showing the [SIADEX](https://github.com/IgnacioVellido/HPDL-Planner) integration with the [unified-planning](https://github.com/aiplan4eu/unified-planning/tree/master/notebooks) framework.

For examples on how UPF works, take a look at the repo [notebooks](https://github.com/aiplan4eu/unified-planning/tree/master/notebooks).

__NOTE__: At the moment the UPF version working with SIADEX is hosted in [this fork](https://github.com/IgnacioVellido/unified-planning).


## SIADEX Basic Usage

In this notebook we show the basic usage of SIADEX and the hierarchical structures of UPF.

<!-- In particular we will go through the following steps:
* create a classical planning problem;
* call a planner to solve the problem;
* go beyond plan generation showing how to validate a plan and how to ground a planning problem;
* call multiple planners in parallel;
* read and write PDDL problems. -->


## Analysing the Decomposition Tree of a Plan

In this notebook we explore the `DecompositionTree` class that gives insights of what the planner has done to reach a resulting plan.
